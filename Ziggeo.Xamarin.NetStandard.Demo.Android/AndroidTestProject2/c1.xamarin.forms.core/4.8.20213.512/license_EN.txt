Xamarin apps built using ComponentOne Studio for Xamarin controls require a valid app key to compile and run. App keys are validated once, upon creation, and continue to remain active indefinitely until the app identifier changes, or the controls are updated to a version outside the subscription window. App keys can be generated once the developer purchases a subscription to Studio for Xamarin, Studio Enterprise or other product bundle that includes Xamarin components. 

For trial purposes, download the ComponentOne Studio for Xamarin samples at github.com/GoXuni/C1-Studio-for-Xamarin/ or from the www.grapecity.com website.

If you have a subscription, generate an app key from your account licenses page at www.grapecity.com/licensing/generate-app-key.
